# Introspect disks available on the machines using a container

Similar to eDeploy introspetion feature.
We run a container and it scans all the devices available, return a list to k8s for the host where the container was ran.
Make sure the next container (the actual OSD) will run on the same machine (the one that was introspected), maybe we can then force where to run the container.
